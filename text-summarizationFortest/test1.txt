Remote working challenges 
Frequently asked security questions from our clients At Avanade, we are 
committed to sharing 
our expertise and 
insight so that you can 
keep your business 
productive and your 
employees engaged 
during this time. Here we share the most frequently 
asked security questions we are 
hearing, from our clients in IT and 
business leadership roles across the 
globe, about remote working. These 
cover everything from questions around 
managing cultural considerations, to 
enabling effective collaboration to 
securing the workplace. How do I scale remote working           
capabilities securely? 
The unprecedented demand for accessing company 
resources remotely puts extra pressure on access 
points and VPN services. The user experience and the 
ability to work remotely depend on your infrastruc-
ture’s ability to scale in order to meet the demand. 
A modern born-in-the-cloud Application Proxy 
solution that enables secure remote access to     
internal web applications – with additional security 
checks via conditional access and MFA – is highly 
scalable. And it can support a broad range of 
authentication capabilities. 
You can also complement your traditional VPN 
technology with new cloud remote access solutions 
that will improve remote worker security while 
alleviating capacity risks on your legacy VPN solution. 
Enable split tunneling where possible so users can get 
the fastest access to cloud services and alleviate traffic 
to a central VPN solution. At the same time, confirm 
your capacity on traditional remote access 
technologies, such as VPN concentrators, next-
generation layer 7 firewalls and circuits. 
What other security challenges do I need to 
consider when more of the workforce is 
working from home?
Provide guidance to employees on best practices 
regarding security on their home network.   
Understand the users who have increased 
requirements for security, such as those handling 
sensitive data. Help employees to control where data 
resides and is processed by considering what security 
policies should be extended to corporate-owned 
devices or even personal devices. 
Configure information protection for classifying and 
managing sensitive corporate data at rest and in 
motion. Enabling BYOD for employees and partners 
may require enhanced security and compliance 
controls for corporate assets through an endpoint 
management solution. Finally, consider reviewing and 
assigning policies to ensure and enforce secure 
behaviors. To achieve that, provide employees with 
clear, prescriptive guidance to help them adopt the 
behaviors required to remain secure in any remote 
working scenario. How can I provide my employees with an 
advanced protected environment for 
collaboration? 
Implement a security layer in Office 365, such as Azure 
Information Protection, which allows you to configure 
policies and protect company data from cyberattacks. 
Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) 
on the employee’s devices gives you visibility into risks 
before they become issues. Also ensure each employee 
has a company or personal device, like a smartphone 
(ideally enabled with biometric authentication), to 
receive the necessary codes to access corporate data 
(via multifactor authentication). This requires a 
subscription to the P1 plan (included in Office 365 
Business) or P2 (included in Office 365 E5, A5 and 
Microsoft 365).
How can my employees interact and collaborate 
securely with their external partners? 
Deploy an external sharing solution (with Microsoft 
Azure B2B) to allow employees to maintain business 
continuity and collaborate with external partners, 
clients or vendors. This solution provides additional 
control and management over Office 365 platform 
services. It also features identity lifecycle capabilities, 
such as onboarding and deleting Azure B2B accounts, 
modify permission and more.
This needs an active Office 365 platform as well          
as Azure Active Directory licenses (AAD Premium      
P1 or P2). How do I protect my information if it leaves   
the organization?
Company data that can be accessed remotely or sent 
remotely can remain “containerized” and be managed 
securely by using Microsoft Intune, Information 
Protection and Azure AD.
This enables users to access Office applications from 
their home laptop or mobile by protecting information 
with Microsoft Application Management (MAM)        
and Windows Information Protection (WIP),      
securing Office 365 data within Office desktop and 
mobile applications.
Microsoft Information Protection can further protect 
information by classifying and protecting assets     
using document-level encryption and access control 
lists. This is supported cross-platform and cross-device. Can I monitor who has access to data and 
applications, and monitor what they’re doing 
with them?
If you’re concerned that employees are using external 
file sharing services to work around internal IT 
limitations, you can monitor and assess this with Cloud 
App Security Broker, which can discover the cloud 
applications being used in your enterprise. It identifies 
and combats cyberthreats and enables you to control 
how your data travels. 
How do I ensure the right people get the right 
access to resources?
 It all starts with managing identities. Whether your 
organization has a hybrid environment or is fully in the 
cloud, checks and balances can be put in place around 
identification, authentication and authorization and to 
ensure monitoring continually takes places. 
Policies and conditional access rules will ensure that the 
right people get access to the right resources 
(applications, data, services) at the right time.
How do I securely enable access to my 
organization’s applications remotely?
Most organizations are running lots of business-critical 
apps on-premises, many of which may not be 
accessible from outside the corporate network. 
Azure AD Application Proxy is a lightweight agent that 
enables internet access to your on-premises apps, 
without opening up broad access to your network. You 
can combine this with your existing Azure AD 
authentication and Conditional Access policies to help 
keep your users and data secured. 
How do I enable access to resources on BYOD 
devices? 
With more employees working remotely and across 
devices, it’s important to support BYOD scenarios. You 
can offer self-service enrollment so users can quickly 
and easily join Azure AD and enroll in Microsoft 
Endpoint Manager (MEM) to access company 
resources. 
Once enrolled, MEM then applies appropriate policies, 
for example, to ensure that a device is encrypted with a 
strong password and has certificates to access things 
like VPNs and Wi-Fi. MEM can also ensure that devices 
are adhering to policy by checking-in the device’s 
health compliance status to Azure AD as it processes 
the user’s authentication.  
How can I enroll my employee’s personal 
mobile devices to securely access corporate 
applications?
Our recommendation is to deploy an enterprise mobile 
device management platform such as Microsoft Intune 
to securely enable employees to get access to 
corporate applications. This will allow a separation of 
corporate data and personal data at a device level 
while maintaining business productivity. 
You’ll need an active Office 365 platform with Azure 
Active Directory and Microsoft Intune licenses (either 
standalone or as part of EMS E3/E5). If you have any specific remote working challenges please
