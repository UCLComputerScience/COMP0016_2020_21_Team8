/**
 * Adds support for Microsoft Teams specific events and interactions.
 * @remarks
 * Developers may handle Conversation Update activities sent from Microsoft Teams via two methods:
 *  1. Overriding methods starting with `on..` and *not* ending in `..Event()` (e.g. `onTeamsMembersAdded()`), or instead
 *  2. Passing callbacks to methods starting with `on..` *and* ending in `...Event()` (e.g. `onTeamsMembersAddedEvent()`),
 *      to stay in line with older {@link ActivityHandler} implementation.
 *
 * Developers should use either #1 or #2, above for all Conversation Update activities and not *both* #2 and #3 for the same activity. Meaning,
 *   developers should override `onTeamsMembersAdded()` and not use both `onTeamsMembersAdded()` and `onTeamsMembersAddedEvent()`.
 *
 * Developers wanting to handle Invoke activities *must* override methods starting with `handle...()` (e.g. `handleTeamsTaskModuleFetch()`).
